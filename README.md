# COVID-19-Forecasting

<br>


## Introduction
<br>

This is a project initiated by [the COVID19 Global Forecasting Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/overview) intending to utilize data science to forecast the number of Cronavirus spread around the world. Pandemic is a heavy topic for everyone. I wanted to contribute with my knowledge in data science to potentially help discover the patterns of the Coronavirus spread and important features that affects the spread. Hopefully my findings can be helpful to lead some regions to take the correct actions.
